# Loose Equality with Null in Function Arguments

This repository demonstrates an uncommon JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`) comparisons with `null` values in function arguments.  The bug can lead to unexpected behavior and conditional logic not executing as intended.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version using strict equality (`===`).
